// This is a BFS Traversal on a Matrix representation.
// We use ITERATIVE Approach on this file.

// Your goal is to create the RECURSIVE Approach of DFS on a Matrix.
// If you've read/seen BFSListTraversal/index.c, it was written there
// that recursive approach on a BFS traversal is unnatural, but not impossible.
// See the solution.c inside BFSMatrixTraversal.
